# Project Landing Page

Practice implementation of The Odin Project's landing page assignment. The repo includes a polished static page (`landing-page/`) and a small Node playground (`node/`) for JavaScript experiments.

---

## Highlights

- Pixel-perfect hero, information, quote, and call-to-action sections built with semantic HTML and modern Flexbox layouts.
- Single external dependency: Google Fonts (`Roboto` family).
- No build tooling required—open the HTML file directly or serve it with any static server.
- Ready to deploy on GitHub Pages in a few clicks.

## Run Locally

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `landing-page/index.html` in any modern browser.
3. Edit `index.css` to experiment with layout, colors, or typography. Styles are grouped into well-labeled sections for quick navigation.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Create a GitHub repository and push this project.
2. Move/rename `landing-page` contents into the repo root (or configure Pages to point at `/landing-page`).
3. In your repo, open **Settings → Pages**.
4. Select the branch (here `landing-page`) and the folder (`/root`) to publish.
5. Save—GitHub Pages will build and provide a public URL within a minute.

Happy building!
